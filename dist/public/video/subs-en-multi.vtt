00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:1
The Web is always changing

2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:2
and the way we access it is changing

3
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:3
The source of that change is <c.highlight>you</c>

4
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:4
Developers all around the world who are using our tools to create great new things (and more copy to see new line)

5
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:5
and with so many tools, the sky is the limit

6
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:6
But it cant happen without you and your ideas

7
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:7
We want to know you better

8
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:8
so we created a new place just for that

9
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:9
to hear from <u>you</u>

10
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:10
We want to hear what inspires you as a developer

11
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:11
and how we can help.

12
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:12
Here you can record a video, share stories with us and more

13
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:13
Let us know what being a Google developer means to you

14
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:14
and you can talk to us in person at Google Developer events all over the world.

15
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:15
so we can learn how to support you better.

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.600
Oh, btw, we also started rolling a new site for Google Developers

17
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.400
Not just code but community, news, tools and other resources

18
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.000
and cake

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.000
Like any open source project it's a work in progress

20
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.000
with your help it can be great

21
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
"developers.google.com/stories"

21
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.000
Change is important to the Web. Help us keep changing it together
